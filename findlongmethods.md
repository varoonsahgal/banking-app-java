# Refactoring Long Methods

## Introduction

This guide will walk you through the process of identifying and refactoring long methods in a Java application. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a cleaner, more maintainable codebase.

## Steps to Refactor Long Methods

### 1. Identify Long Methods

Long methods can be difficult to maintain and understand. In this example, we'll identify a method in a hypothetical `StudentManagement` class that performs multiple tasks and is a good candidate for refactoring.

### 2. Extract Method

Extract smaller methods from the long method to handle specific tasks. This improves readability and maintainability.

### Example: Refactoring `processStudentData`

The `processStudentData` method handles multiple responsibilities: reading student data, processing grades, and generating reports. We'll refactor it into smaller methods.

#### Original `processStudentData` Method

```java
public class StudentManagement {

    public void processStudentData() {
        // Read student data
        List<Student> students = readStudentData();
        
        // Process grades
        for (Student student : students) {
            processGrades(student);
        }
        
        // Generate reports
        generateReports(students);
    }

    private List<Student> readStudentData() {
        // Implementation to read student data
    }

    private void processGrades(Student student) {
        // Implementation to process grades
    }

    private void generateReports(List<Student> students) {
        // Implementation to generate reports
    }
}
